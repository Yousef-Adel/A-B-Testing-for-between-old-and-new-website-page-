# Analyze A/B Test Results
## Overview
### The project conducted A/B testing of user conversions on an old and new web page.

### The dateset attributes indcludes:
- Unique used ID
- Timestamp
- Group (control and treatment)
- landing page (old_page & new page)
- converted (boolen)

### Steps included:
- Handling mismatched conditions
- Removing duplicate IDS in the dataset 
- Hypothesis testing via bootstrapping and standard statistical tests, and multiple regression modelling.

## Statistical Analysis
•	Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations

•	Z-core tests

•	Logistic regression

•	Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables

## Technologies Used
•	Python(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy) Libraries
•	Jupyter Notebook (IDE)

## Key Findings
•	The conversion rate for the new page was not superior to that for the old page
•	The country of the user did not impact the rate of conversion between the new and old page
